        <p style="text-align:justify;"> 
            I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Melbourne, where my research focuses on understanding the dynamics of cellular processes.
            Within my PhD research, I am concerned with developing links between theoretical models and experimental data to identify the role of mitochondrial dynamics, cellular energetic distribution, and actin filament polymerisation in cell migration.
            My work aims to incorporate deep learning driven image segmentation, dynamic systems biology modelling, and spatial quantification to investigate multi-scale cellular dynamics. 
            However, my broad research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and mathematical modelling, and I am passionate about bridging the gap between theory and experimental practice.

            Prior to beginning my PhD, I was working at Alkira Bio as a Protein Engineer, where I focused on developing innovative wet laboratory techniques.
            My role involved optimising and implementing experimental methodologies to enhance protein characterisation, engineering, and purfication.
            Here, my work was focused on the seratonin and dopaminergic receptor families with an aim to build up the companies nanobody discovery pipeline.
            Ultimately, I would like to couple computational protein design with deep learning and modelling of cellular dynamics (including subcellular organelle interactions) and cellular processes for better cellular context-specific drug design.
